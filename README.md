Written Report

The analysis reveals a noteworthy distinction, particularly in mathematics, in pass rates between 
district and charter schools, despite similar levels of spending per student within the same 
range.
Enrollment varies significantly, ranging from the lowest school with 427 students to the highest. 
with 4,976 students. Among the lower-performing district schools, there is no substantial 
difference in the average pass rate, and the same holds true for the charter schools.
It is worth noting that the student-to-teacher ratio and demographic data have not been. 
provided, and these factors could potentially contribute to the observed differences. 
Additionally, the availability of student resources may play a contributory role, particularly in 
mathematics, where the pass rate in district schools falls below 70%. Therefore, more focused 
efforts should be directed towards improving math scores, as reading scores remain consistent.
